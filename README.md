Use the file main to preprocess and predict the data.
There is ONNX file for the model itself, but I believe that the main point is the data preprocessing I did, more then the ML model itself

I would be very glad to elaborate more, since the amount of analysis I've made is huge, and didn't have time to cover all the analysis results here in detail

For more information - check out the Jupyter notebook
